\title{Compute expected improvement in GWAS power}
\usage{
compute_power_improvement(h2_original, h2_transformed, rg, n_samples = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{h2_original}{Heritability of original trait}

\item{h2_transformed}{Heritability of transformed trait}

\item{rg}{Genetic correlation between original and transformed}

\item{n_samples}{Sample size}
}
\value{
List with power improvement metrics
}
\description{
Estimate the expected improvement in GWAS power from using transformed trait
based on the genetic correlation and heritability changes.
}
\details{
The effective sample size for detecting a variant is approximately:
N_eff = N * h2 * rg^2

So the improvement factor is:
improvement = (h2_transformed * rg^2) / h2_original
}
